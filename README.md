# Deep-learning-nanodegree-from-Udacity

Finaaaaally! 

After Data analyses Nanodegree, Deep learning Nanodegree is DONE 

"Deep Learning Nanodegree" offered by Udacity and egFWD, It is worth noting that Deep Learning nanodegree is the best nanodegree I've taken so far! , I will study the course in the future a second, third and fourth time because it is worth all the trouble


The Expert track - Deep Learning Nanodegree consisted of 6 main topics:

1- Intro to Deep Learning

2- Neural Networks

3- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

4- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

5- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

6- Deploying a Model through AWS SageMaker
