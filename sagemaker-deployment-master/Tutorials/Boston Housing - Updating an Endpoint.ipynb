    "In this notebook, we will continue working with the [Boston Housing Dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~delve/data/boston/bostonDetail.html). Our goal in this notebook will be to train two different models and to use SageMaker to switch a deployed endpoint from using one model to the other. One of the benefits of using SageMaker to do this is that we can make the change without interrupting service. What this means is that we can continue sending data to the endpoint and at no point will that endpoint disappear.\n",

    "Typically, when using a notebook instance with SageMaker, you will proceed through the following steps. Of course, not every step will need to be done with each project. Also, there is quite a lot of room for variation in many of the steps, as you will see throughout these lessons.\n",

Before we talk about how we can change a deployed endpoint from one configuration to another, let's consider a slightly different situation. Suppose that before we switch from using only the XGBoost model to only the Linear model, we first want to do something like an A-B test, where we send some of the incoming data to the XGBoost model and some of the data to the Linear model.\n",

The only difference is that we need to list more than one model in the production variants parameter of the endpoint configuration.\n",
